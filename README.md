# A more stable `thelook` 

## Why `thelook_stable`?

  - There are other repos/forks of `thelook`, however these repos have historically been a playground for Looker employees creating a lot of demo material as well as instability in the model.
  - For our internal tests (such as performance/regression tests) we need a stable model that has releases tags.
